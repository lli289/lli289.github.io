## Instructor
I held problem-solving discussions and taught courses to undergraduate students. For each class, I prepared lecture notes, problem sets, and provided detailed solutions to each problem. 

## SUMSRI
The Summer Undergraduate Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (SUMSRI) is a seven week program hosted by the Department of Mathematics at Miami University. The program aims to support undergraduate students, particularly those from underrepresented demographic groups, in pursuing research and graduate education in the mathematical field. Each year, approximately 15 undergraduate students from across the country are selected to participate in the program. During the program, students haev the opportunity to conduct research under the guidance of a faculty member in the mathematics department.
