## Teaching Assistant
As a teaching assistant, my primary responsibilities were grading homework assignment and exams, while providing solutions and detailed feedback to enhance students' leaning. To ensure effective communication and support, I stayed highly organized with good time management and made myself readily available to students via prompt email responses, in- person and virtual office hours, and assistance both during and outside of scheduled office hours. Additionally, I scheduled Zoom meetins with students to address any questions or concerns that arose during the course.

## Textbooks
* Required Textbooks: none
* Optional Textbooks:

     + Terry E. Dielman, "Applied Regression Analysis"
     + Douglas C. Montgomery, "Design and Analysis of Expedriments"

## Course Description
Course begins with an applied regression module that emphasizes analysis and interpretation of real data, and statistical computing. Second part of course focuses on principles and implementation of experimental design for scientific research purposes. Standard designs presented along with the proper kinds of analysis for each. Continued emphasis on real data and statistical computing using R and/or SAS.

## Student Learning Outcomes
The primary goals of this course are:

* To perform a full regression analysis of simple data.
* To interpret and summarize the results you obtain.
* To think critically about applications of regression methods in your field of study.
* Design simple experiments to test hypotheses about specified treatments
* Analyze the data you collect in a statistical software package and report on your results.
* Think critically about the design of experiments in your own work and in published work from researchers in your field. 

## Software
R and/or SAS.
