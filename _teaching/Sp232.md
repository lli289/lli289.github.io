## Teaching Assistant
My primary responsibilities were grading homework assignments (5) and exams (2), while providing detailed feedback to enhance students' leaning experience. I also assisted students with debugging or troubleshooting R code in case of errors. To ensure effective communication and support, I maintained a high level of organization and made myself readily available to students via prompt email responses, discussion board posts (5 Modules), and assistance both during and outside of working hours. Additionally, I scheduled Zoom meetings with students to address any questions or concerns that arose during the course.

## Textbooks
* Required Textbooks: John K. Kruschke, "Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial with R, JAGS, and Stan"

## Course Description
This course provides an introduction to Bayesian inference and a summary of Bayesian methods for fitting, assessing, and selecting models. Topics include Bayesâ€™ Rule and probability, Binomial models for proportions, Poisson models for counts, Normal models for continuous data, linear regression, log-linear and contingency tables, hierarchical models, hypothesis testing, model comparison,
and selected applications.

## Student Learning Outcomes
The primary goals of this course are:

* Understanding the Bayesian interpretation of probability.
* Defining simple models for comparison of proportions and means, linear regression, and generalized linear models.
* Defining hierarchical models for comparison of proportions and means, linear regression, and generalized linear models.
* Fitting simple models via Bayesian estimation methods, including approximate and sampling-based techniques.
* Estimating complicated models using specialized software, such as JAGS and STAN.

## Software
R.
