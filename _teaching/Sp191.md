## Graduate Assistant
My primary responsibilities were attending each lecture in person with students and lecturer, grading exams, leading smaller sessions twice a week where students actively engaged in problem-solving, reviewing course materials from the large lectures. Additionally, I posted weekly summaries on Canvas, provided detailed solutions to problem sets, assisted with WebAssign homework, and offered in person office hours. 

## Course Description
This course is intended to prepare students for Calculus I. The course covers the fundamentals including the real numbers, exponents and radicals, equations, non-linear inequalities, and graphing on the coordinate plane. We will also explore a variety of functions and their properties including linear, polynomial, rational, trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions, as well as considering inverse functions and combining functions with composition.
