## Lillian

I am a Ph.D. candidate of statistics in the Dr. Bing Zhang Department of Statistics, University of Kentucky. I am very fortunate to be advised by XXX throughout my doctoral study. Prior to this, I received my M.S. in Statistics from the University of Kentucky in 2021, under the supervision of XXX, and M.S. in Mathematics from the Miami University in 2019, under the guidance of XXX. Before that I received my B.S. in Mathematics from the Miami Unievrsity.
