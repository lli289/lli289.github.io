I am Ph.D. candidate of statistics in the Dr. Bing Zhang Department of Statistics, University of Kentucky. I am very fortunate to be advised by XXX throughout my doctoral studies. Prior to this, I received my M.S. in Statistics from the University of Kentucky in 2021, under the supervision of XXX, and a M.S. in Mathematics from the Miami University in 2019, under the guidance of XXX. Before that I received my B.S. in Mathematics from the Miami Unievrsity.
