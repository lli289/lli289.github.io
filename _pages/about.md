## Hey there! I'm Lillian 

I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from the [Dr. Bing Zhang Department of Statistics](https://stat.as.uky.edu/), [University of Kentucky](https://www.uky.edu/), advised by [Dr. Chenglong Ye](https://web.as.uky.edu/statistics/users/cye229/index.html). I received my M.S. in Statistics from the [University of Kentucky](https://www.uky.edu/) in May, 2021, and M.S. in Mathematics from the [Miami University](https://miamioh.edu/) in May, 2019, advised by [Dr. Alexandru Alin Pogan](https://community.miamioh.edu/directory/entry/pogana). Before that I received my B.S. in Mathematics from the [Miami University](https://miamioh.edu/) in May, 2016.
