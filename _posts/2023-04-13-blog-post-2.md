Welcome to this continuously updated blog post where I'll be sharing R tips and tricks that I find helpful while coding. These range from simple one-liners to more complex functions that can save you time and effort. Some of the examples below may be too specific and not useful to you, while others are general R tips. I'm always interested in finding efficient solutions to complex problems and simplifying my code. In this post, you'll find useful R tricks that have helped me boost my coding process and increase productivity. I decided to regularly update this post because I sometimes forget how to code something or how a particular code worked over time. By updating this post regularly, I can stay organized and make it easy to search for code examples in case I encounter similar problems later. Hopefully, you'll find something useful in this post too.

ଘ(੭*ˊᵕˋ)੭* ̀ˋStay tuned and happy coding! 

### 1. dplyr::filter()
```{r}
df <- data.frame(Letter = c("A","A","B","C","D"), Count = c(1,2,1,1,1))
df
  Letter Count
1      A     1
2      A     2
3      B     1
4      C     1
5      D     1

# Goal: select rows in df where Letter is A and count is 1. e.g.

  Letter Count
1      A     1
```
* Method 1:
```{r}
suppressWarnings(df[which(df$Letter == "A" && df$Count == 1), ])
```
* Method 2:
```{r}
library("dplyr")
df %>% 
   dplyr::filter(Letter == "A" & Count == 1)
```

**Average time comparison of two methods above under 100 replications:** Method 1: 0.00019 secs vs. Method 2: 0.00094 secs

Although Method 1 runs slightly faster in this mini example, Method 2 is easier to code. Also, it's important to note that without using suppressWarnings(), Method 1 would return a warning message due to calling "&&". See this [link](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/NEWS.html) for more details.

### 2. outer()
