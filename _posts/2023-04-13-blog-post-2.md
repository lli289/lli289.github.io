Welcome to this continuously updated blog post where I'll be sharing R tips and tricks that I find helpful while coding. These range from simple one-liners to more complex functions that can save you time and effort. Some of the examples below may be too specific and not useful to you, while others are general R tips. I'm always interested in finding efficient solutions to complex problems and simplifying my code. In this post, you'll find useful R tricks that have helped me boost my coding process and increase productivity. I decided to regularly update this post because I sometimes forget how to code something or how a particular code worked over time. By updating this post regularly, I can stay organized and make it easy to search for code examples in case I encounter similar problems later. Hopefully, you'll find something useful in this post too.

ଘ(੭*ˊᵕˋ)੭* ̀ˋStay tuned and happy coding!
