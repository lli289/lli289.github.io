## Background:
I came across two error messages while using the $\bf{rstan}$ package in Rstudio. The error messages read as follows:

* Error 1: "failed to create lock directory "
* Error 2: "compileCode(f, code, language = language, verbose = verbose)"


$\textbf{Operating system:}$ Windows, $\textbf{R version:}$ 4.2.3.

## Solutions:
* Error 1 was easy to fix, simply run the following line before installing the package.

```{r}
options("install.lock"=FALSE)
```

* Error 2 was a bit tricky. I tried with several solutions and none of it worked. I then learned from this [link](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/Configuring-C---Toolchain-for-Windows) that the current version of RStan on CRAN is not compatible with R 4.2.3. The following lines will resolve the error.

```{r}
remove.packages(c("StanHeaders","rstan"))
install.packages("StanHeaders", repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))
install.packages("rstan", repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))
library(rstan)
```

Now you can check by running the example model code from Stan, and you should be able to run the following line without encountering any error messages.

```{r}
example(stan_model, package = "rstan", run.dontrun = TRUE)
```
