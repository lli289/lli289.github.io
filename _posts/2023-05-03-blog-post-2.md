## Background:
Recently, I enrolled in an online course and stumbled upon swirl, a package for learning R, in R. I think that this is a valuable tool and an excellent way for beginners to learn R and I quickly fall in love with it. I believe there's something for everyone on swirl, whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced R user looking to expand skills. Thus, in this blog post, I'd like to share some of the courses in swirl that I found helpful. More information about swirl can be found in this [link](http://www.simonqueenborough.info/R/basic/intro-to-swirl)

$\textbf{Operating system:}$ Windows, $\textbf{R version:}$ 4.2.3.

## Install swirl
```{r}
install.packages("swirl")
library(swirl) 
```

The three courses I recommend are:

* R Programming
* Getting and Cleaning Data
* Exploratory Data Analysis

## Install courses
```{r}
install_course("R Programming")
install_course("Getting and Cleaning Data")
install_course("Exploratory Data Analysis")
```

## Run swirl
