Recently, I enrolled in an online course and stumbled upon swirl, a package for learning R, in R. I think that this is a great tool and an excellent way for beginners to learn R. I quickly fall in love with it. I believe there's something for everyone on swirl, whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced R user looking to expand skills. Thus, in this blog post, I'd like to share some of the courses in swirl that I found helpful.
