## Background:
After updating several packages, I came across this error message in Rstudio. The error message read as follows:

"loadNamespace(j <- i[[1L]], c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[j]])"

On top of it, I was unable to uninstall or reinstall any R packages.

$\textbf{Operating system:}$ Windows, $\textbf{R version:}$ 4.2.3.

## Solutions:
I learned from this [link](https://statisticsglobe.com/warning-cannot-remove-prior-installation-in-r).

* Step 1: Run line below in Rstudio Console:
```{r}
.libPaths()  
```
A path returned which tells you where your packages are installed

* Step 2: Follow the path, I then manually searched and deleted all packages that I want to re-install.

  Note: If you cannot find a folder, it may be hidden. To view hidden files and folders, see this [link](https://www.sonarworks.com/support/sonarworks/360003040160-Troubleshooting/360003204140-Troubleshooting/5005750481554-How-to-show-hidden-files-Mac-and-Windows-).

* Step 3: Install and library your packages:
```{r}
options("install.lock"=FALSE)
install.packages("package_name")
library(package_name)
```
